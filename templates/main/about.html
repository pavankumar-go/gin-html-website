                <h1>Hi! I'm Pavan</h1>
                <p>I would love to share with you all my captures of some of the beautiful birds and hope to inspire a
                    visitor of this site :)</p>
                <p1>
                    I am a devops engineer and a hobbyist photographer based in Bengaluru.<br>
                    I started out as a hobbyist photographer with the urge to understand, watch and capture the behaviours
                    of as many bird species as possible.
                    To share my enjoyment and sightings of these cuties, have created this simple website as a medium for
                    showcase.
